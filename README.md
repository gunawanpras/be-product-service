# be-product-service
## Features

The API lets you manage products easily. Hereâ€™s what you can do:

- Add New Product

    Create a new product by sending all the necessary details (like category, supplier, unit, name, description, base price, and stock) to the `/products` endpoint.

    **Example**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/products \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "category_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
        "supplier_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000011",
        "unit_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000021",
        "name": "Kangkung Potong 1",
        "description": "Kangkung Potong segar",
        "base_price": 3000,
        "stock": 100
    }'
    ```

- List All Products

    Retrieve a list of all available products. You can also filter by adding query parameters.

    **Example**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/products
    ```

- Get Product By ID

    Fetch detailed information about a specific product using its unique ID.

    **Example**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/products/66100efd-e17c-470e-aa8c-5fba02949266
    ```

- Search Products by Name

    Find products by providing a search string for the product name.

    **Example**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/products?product_name=kangkung"
    ```

- Search & Filter Products

    Combine search and filter by product name and category type.

    **Example**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/products?product_name=kangkung&category_type=Sayuran"
    ```

- Sort Products

    Retrieve a sorted list of products by specifying a sort field and direction.

    **Example 1**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/products?sort=name&directive=asc"
    ```

    **Example 2**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/products?sort=base_price&directive=desc"
    ```

- clean: Stops and removes Docker containers and volumes for a fresh start.
- init: Prepares the project by tidying Go dependencies, building and starting Docker containers, and waiting for the database.
- db_migrate: Resets and applies database migrations to update the schema.

## Performance and Testing

**Cache**: This project uses Redis to store frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database and improving overall performance. Both SQL queries and responses are cached to minimize latency.

**Unit Tests**: The project includes a set of unit tests to ensure the handlers, services and repositories are functioning properly.

**End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: The project also includes E2E tests that simulate real-world scenarios.
